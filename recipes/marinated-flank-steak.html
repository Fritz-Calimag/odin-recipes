        A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want 
        a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. Make sure you marinate your flank 
        steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. 
        This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is 
        sliced and used for fajitas.

    <p>
        Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal 
        muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: 
        Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, 
        and it benefits greatly from marination.

    </h2>
    <p>
        There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak 
        is grilled â€” we love the bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can 
        also easily cook your flank steak in the oven or on the stove.
