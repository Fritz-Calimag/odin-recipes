# odin-recipes
The current project that this repo is working on is a basic HTML recipe website. The website will have a simple index page and a few links to other webpages containing recipes. I'm going to demonstrate how to use proper elements and tags, how to follow a good boilerplate, how to make lists, and lastly how to use anchors and references alongside images. I will also be documenting the progress of this project by using proper commit messages in git.
